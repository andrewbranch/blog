I live in beautiful Marin County, California, ten miles north of San Francisco, where I moved in 2015 and lived until the pandemic made me want to go somewhere with easier access to the outdoors.

I work on the TypeScript language and compiler at Microsoft. A lot of what Iâ€™ve worked on has been more or less related to [modules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules).

Outside of work, Iâ€™m currently climbing, diving, and woodworking. I made a pretty good table and bed frame. I also occasionally backpack (I thru-hiked the [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail) in 2014), or [bike](/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor) across a small country.
